## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).

## Results

Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the model is 0.99, indicating that it correctly classifies 99% of the instances. Precision:

Healthy loans (0): The model has a precision of 1.00, which means it's excellent at identifying true positives with very few false positives.
High-risk loans (1): The model has a precision of 0.87, indicating its moderate effectiveness in identifying high-risk loans with some false positives. Recall:
Healthy loans (0): The model has a recall of 1.00, which means it's correctly identifying nearly all instances of healthy loans with very few false negatives.
High-risk loans (1): The model has a recall of 0.89, indicating its effectiveness in identifying high-risk loans with some false negatives.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
